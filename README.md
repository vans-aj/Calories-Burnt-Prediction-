# Calories-Burnt-Prediction 🔥
A machine learning-based system that predicts the number of calories burnt based on user activity using **XGBoost Regression**. Trained on real-world data from Kaggle to ensure high accuracy.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 **Predicts** calorie burn based on user activity details like age, weight, and duration.
- ⚡ Uses **XGBoost Regression** for high accuracy and performance.
- 📊 **Trained** on real-world fitness datasets (`calories.csv` and `exercise.csv` from Kaggle).
- 🖥️ Easy-to-use **web interface** for predictions.
